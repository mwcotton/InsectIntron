| bladapter.py        | Library to handle standard blast output.                           |
| get_sequences.py    | Save full contig identified from a blast.                          |
| quick_seqs.py       | Quickly save full contiq identified from a blast.                  |
| make_tree_fasta.py  | Saves contig and sequence information ready for tree generation.   |
| top_contigs.py      | Saves the top hit for each species.                                |
